### 🧠 Thoughts
- Arch broke(SDDM not working) after update so, trying to fix it, time turned 6 PM 
- Disabled SDDM service for now by systemctl using chroot.
- now, switched to sddm instead of sddm-git 
- WAYBAR -> keyboard-state is not appearing in waybar.
-  Brightness module -> DONE and others too.
- No Code done today.. going to sleep log out -- 12:04 AM
